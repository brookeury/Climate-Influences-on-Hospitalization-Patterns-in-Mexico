# Climate-Influences-on-Hospitalization-Patterns-in-Mexico

This directory has the code needed to replicate the analysis in "Climate Influences on Hospitalization Patterns in Mexico: Evidence from 30 Million Records" by Ury et al.

To replicate the results and run the scripts, the following data is required:

The Subsistema Automatizado de Egresos Hospitalarios (SAEH) dataset, published by the National Health Information System of the Mexican Department of Health. The data can be found here: http://www.dgis.salud.gob.mx/contenidos/sinais/s_saeh.html

Precipitation and precipitation data are available from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) model published by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.narr.html
